# Garbage Collection by Ants using PycxSimulator
This is an Agent-based model simulates a 2-D space with many tiny pieces of garbage scattered around. On this space, ants will be wandering randomly. Whenever the ants see garbage at their new location, their behaviors will be:
1.	Dropping the garbage to that location if the ant is having.
2.	Picking up the garbage from ground if the ant isn't carrying anything.
